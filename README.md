#### A Python script to compute TTFL statistics and send Top 30 tweet

To get it work you should check the requirements.txt and install what is missing on your computer.

Then in a Python environment launch the command:
```commandline
python nba.py
```

This should create a ttfl_output.html file that should be identical to the ttfl_output_golden.html file in the GoldenOutput folder
